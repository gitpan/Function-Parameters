Revision history for Function-Parameters

0.06    2012-06-19
        - complete rewrite in XS
        - require perl 5.14+
        - hopefully fix bug where it would get the line numbers wrong
        - we're a lexical pragma now; remove import_into()
        - more fine-grained control over behavior of generated keywords:
           * function name can be optional/required/prohibited
           * invocant name can be any variable, not just $self
           * default attributes (and method now defaults to ':method')
