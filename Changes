Revision history for Function-Parameters

0.07    2012-06-25
        - completely rework internals to generate optrees directly
          (no more generating/reparsing source)
        - simplify / fewer dependencies
        - new feature: default arguments (on by default)
        - new feature: strict argument count checks (off by default)
                       enabled by "*_strict" variants of symbolic types

0.06    2012-06-19
        - complete rewrite in XS
        - require perl 5.14+
        - hopefully fix bug where it would get the line numbers wrong
        - we're a lexical pragma now; remove import_into()
        - more fine-grained control over behavior of generated keywords:
           * function name can be optional/required/prohibited
           * invocant name can be any variable, not just $self
           * default attributes (and method now defaults to ':method')
